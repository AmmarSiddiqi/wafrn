    <p class="mb-3">Regarding what we will do with your data:</p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We are connected with other social networks, so your posts and your images
      could be automatically stored in other servers. Your URL, your blog name
      and your avatar are public information. Your birth date, email and
      password are private and only get stored in our server.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We will store your email and every once in a while send you a small
      campaing so you come back and commit some shitposts (please).
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We need your birth date for legal reasons. Mostly to verify that you are
      older than 13 for the legal regulations here, and older than 18 to see
      images marked as NSFW. If you're under 18 please ask your parents or legal
      tutors.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      We will also store your registration IP, your last login ip and the ip
      that you use when you upload a media like pic or video, so if you post
      something illegal we can comply with the authorities.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      If your account does not get activated in a period between a month and a
      year it might get deleted.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      If you want to get all the data we have about you, or there is any problem
      regarding the GDPR please email us at info&#64;wafrn.net. This is a manual
      process and can take some time.
